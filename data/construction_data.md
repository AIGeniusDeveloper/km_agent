# ConstructionTech Knowledge Base

## Building Materials

### Cement & Concrete
- **Portland Cement**: Standard cement for general construction. Mix ratio 1:2:4 (cement:sand:gravel).
- **Rapid-Setting Cement**: Sets in 30 minutes. Use for repairs and urgent work.
- **Concrete Strength**: C20 (20 MPa) for foundations, C30 for structural elements.

### Local Materials
- **Laterite Blocks**: Compressed earth blocks. Good thermal properties, eco-friendly.
- **Stabilized Earth**: Mix soil with 5-10% cement for improved strength.
- **Bamboo**: Tensile strength similar to steel. Use for scaffolding and reinforcement.

## Foundation Types

### Shallow Foundations
- **Strip Foundation**: For load-bearing walls. Depth: 1-1.5m, width: 600mm minimum.
- **Pad Foundation**: For columns. Size based on load calculation.
- **Raft Foundation**: For weak soils. Distributes load over entire area.

### Deep Foundations
- **Pile Foundation**: For high-rise or poor soil. Depth: 10-30m.
- **Caisson**: For bridge piers and underwater construction.

## Safety Protocols

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- **Hard Hat**: Mandatory on all sites. Replace after impact.
- **Safety Boots**: Steel toe cap, slip-resistant sole.
- **High-Visibility Vest**: Reflective strips, bright color.
- **Gloves**: Leather for handling materials, rubber for concrete work.

### Scaffolding Safety
- **Inspection**: Check daily before use. Look for loose joints, damaged planks.
- **Load Limit**: Maximum 225 kg/m² for working platforms.
- **Fall Protection**: Guardrails at 1m height, toe boards at base.

## Building Codes (African Context)

### Structural Requirements
- **Wall Thickness**: Minimum 225mm for load-bearing walls.
- **Reinforcement**: Steel bars (rebars) spaced 150-300mm in concrete.
- **Roof Pitch**: Minimum 15° for drainage in rainy climates.

### Earthquake Resistance (East Africa)
- **Seismic Zones**: Kenya, Tanzania require earthquake-resistant design.
- **Reinforcement**: Use ductile detailing, tie columns to beams.
- **Foundation**: Deep foundations recommended in seismic areas.

## Construction Techniques

### Masonry
- **Brick Laying**: Use 10mm mortar joints. Check level every 3 courses.
- **Block Laying**: Hollow blocks for walls, solid for pillars.
- **Mortar Mix**: 1:4 (cement:sand) for structural walls, 1:6 for partitions.

### Roofing
- **Corrugated Iron Sheets**: Overlap 150mm, fix every 300mm.
- **Clay Tiles**: Traditional, good insulation. Requires strong roof structure.
- **Concrete Slabs**: Reinforced concrete, 100-150mm thick for residential.

## Cost Estimation

### Material Costs (Approximate, East Africa)
- **Cement**: $8-10 per 50kg bag
- **Sand**: $20-30 per cubic meter
- **Gravel**: $25-35 per cubic meter
- **Steel Bars (12mm)**: $600-700 per ton

### Labor Costs
- **Mason**: $15-25 per day
- **Laborer**: $8-12 per day
- **Carpenter**: $20-30 per day

## Quality Control

### Concrete Testing
- **Slump Test**: Measures workability. Target: 50-100mm for normal work.
- **Cube Test**: Compressive strength at 7 and 28 days.
- **Curing**: Keep concrete moist for 7 days minimum.

### Inspection Checklist
- Foundation depth and width
- Reinforcement placement and spacing
- Concrete mix quality
- Plumbness of walls (vertical alignment)
- Level of floors and beams
