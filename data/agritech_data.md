## Soil Analysis

### Soil Types
- **Sandy Soil**: Good drainage, low water retention. Requires frequent irrigation and organic matter.
- **Clay Soil**: Poor drainage, high water retention. Needs amendment with sand and compost.
- **Loamy Soil**: Ideal balance of sand, silt, and clay. Best for most crops.

### Soil pH
- **Acidic (pH < 6.5)**: Add lime to raise pH. Good for crops like blueberries, potatoes.
- **Neutral (pH 6.5-7.5)**: Ideal for most vegetables and grains.
- **Alkaline (pH > 7.5)**: Add sulfur to lower pH. Suitable for asparagus, beets.

## Crop Diseases

### Tomato Diseases
- **Blight (Early/Late)**: Brown spots on leaves. Remove affected leaves, apply copper fungicide.
- **Fusarium Wilt**: Yellowing leaves, wilting. Use resistant varieties, rotate crops.
- **Blossom End Rot**: Dark spots on fruit bottom. Caused by calcium deficiency. Maintain consistent watering.

### Maize Diseases
- **Corn Smut**: Black galls on ears. Remove infected plants immediately.
- **Northern Corn Leaf Blight**: Gray lesions on leaves. Use resistant hybrids, practice crop rotation.

## Fertilizer Recommendations

### NPK Ratios
- **Leafy Vegetables (Lettuce, Spinach)**: 10-5-5 (High Nitrogen)
- **Fruiting Crops (Tomatoes, Peppers)**: 5-10-10 (High Phosphorus/Potassium)
- **Root Vegetables (Carrots, Potatoes)**: 5-10-10

### Organic Fertilizers
- **Compost**: Balanced nutrients, improves soil structure.
- **Manure**: High nitrogen, must be aged 6 months.
- **Bone Meal**: High phosphorus for root development.

## Irrigation Best Practices

### Water Requirements
- **High Water Crops**: Rice, sugarcane (1500-2000mm/year)
- **Medium Water Crops**: Maize, vegetables (500-800mm/year)
- **Low Water Crops**: Millet, sorghum (300-500mm/year)

### Irrigation Methods
- **Drip Irrigation**: 90% efficiency, ideal for vegetables and orchards.
- **Sprinkler**: 70% efficiency, good for large fields.
- **Furrow**: 50% efficiency, traditional method for row crops.

## Pest Management

### Common Pests
- **Aphids**: Small green insects on leaves. Use neem oil or insecticidal soap.
- **Cutworms**: Cut seedlings at base. Use collars around young plants.
- **Whiteflies**: Tiny white insects under leaves. Use yellow sticky traps.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
1. Monitor crops regularly
2. Use physical barriers (nets, row covers)
3. Encourage beneficial insects (ladybugs, lacewings)
4. Apply pesticides only as last resort
