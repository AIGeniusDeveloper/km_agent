# Diesel Engine Maintenance

## Oil Change
Change the oil every 5000 km or 3 months. Use the recommended oil grade (e.g., 15W-40).

## Filter Replacement
Replace the air filter every 10,000 km. A clogged filter reduces engine performance.

## Troubleshooting
- **Black Smoke**: Indicates incomplete combustion. Check air filter and injectors.
- **Overheating**: Check coolant level and radiator fan.
